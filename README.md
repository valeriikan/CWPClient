The whole app implementation was completed together by sharing and discussing the code, partially paired programming

## Build and usage instructions ##

Project is ready for build in Android Studio

## Testing summary ##

* App conforms basic functionalities covered at first and second demo videos
* Phone-phone, phone-emulator, phone-emulator-phone tested
* Line up overlapping on several devices tested
* Exceptional situations (from Doings 6) tested
* Optional features are not implemened (However app handles wrong frequency and server adress types by catching NumberFormatException)

## Known bug ##
* Run the application
* Connect to the server
* Change frequency straigh from ControlFragment
* Swipe to TappingFragment
* Tap

At this point application's ActionBar disappears until the application is reopened. Bug does not break app functionalities, but looks weird
